Data: 
    T: Training set
    E: Eval set
    A: Active Learning set
    Data generation: Hl o Hs in data_gen.py

Method (one iteration):
    Primal dual constrained learning of GNN on T:
    Evaluate GNN on E.
    Train dual variable predictor (DVP) on T.
    Evaluate DVP on A.
    B <- Most informative from A.
    T = T u B

Questions:
    - Whats this # calculate baseline rates for test phase ? Do we need it in the pool ?
